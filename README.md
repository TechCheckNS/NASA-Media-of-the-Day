# NASA


This website uses the NASA API to pick and display photos/videos of the day. The user can select a date and my website will call the API for the date selected and display the media that NASA has posted for that date. There are also options for next/previous days and I will be implementing a random date option as well. This website was a personal project of mine to familiarize myself more with API calls.
